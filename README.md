## Hi, I'm Alvin 👋

### C Programmer | Aspiring Embedded Software Engineer

I work primarily in **C**, building non-trivial command-line projects that
involve data structures, file handling, and low-level program design.

Currently developing embedded systems skills through hands-on projects
and simulation-based learning, with interests in:
- Firmware development
- Systems programming
- OS internals

📌 **Pinned repositories below showcase my major projects**, including:
- Inverted Search Engine
- Arbitrary Precision Calculator
- MP3 Tag Reader & Editor
